# slashbin-ai-agent (Foreman)

Open-source daemon that drives GitHub work through Claude Code CLI: it implements
approved issues, reviews the resulting PRs, revises them on feedback, and promotes
merged work — across many repos from a single process.

## Cycle

Each poll cycle runs six phases across every configured repo. Phases run in this
order so labels set in one phase are consumed by the right phase next cycle:

```
Reconcile → Review → Revise → Implement → Branch Sync → Promote
```

1. **Reconcile** — detect orphaned commits on the feature branch with no PR; open one.
2. **Review** *(opt-in, `reviewEnabled`)* — for repos with an open feature PR whose
   linked issue is labeled `pr under review`, invoke a **review skill** that reviews,
   merges clean PRs to the base branch, verifies, and transitions labels itself. Runs
   first among PR-acting phases so it only acts on PRs labeled in a *prior* cycle
   (labels settled → no same-cycle race). See **Review phase** below.
3. **Revise** — for issues labeled `pr pending actions` with an open feature PR, invoke
   the revision skill to address review feedback. Prioritized over new implementation.
4. **Implement** — pick up `approved` issues with no delivering PR and invoke the
   implementation skill; on success label the issue `pr under review`.
5. **Branch Sync** — merge `main → develop` to clear post-promotion drift.
6. **Promote** — create `develop → main` promotion PRs for `ready for prod release` issues.

Priority within a cycle is encoded by phase order. Only one Claude session runs at a
time (`implementing` mutex) for git-state safety.

## Review phase

The Review phase is categorically different from Implement/Revise, because review is a
decision-layer workflow rather than an in-repo edit:

- **Runs in a separate review repo when one is set.** With `emRepoPath`, the review
  skill is spawned with its working directory there (not the service repo), so it has
  the reviewer's own MCP servers, verification scripts, and context docs. Without it,
  the cwd is the repo's review checkout (`reviewSessionCwd`). A relative
  `reviewSkillPath` resolves against that same cwd (`resolveReviewSkillPath`).
- **Runs under a separate token.** Reviews/merges are attributed to `EM_GITHUB_TOKEN`
  (distinct from `FOREMAN_GITHUB_TOKEN`) — reviewer identity ≠ implementer identity.
- **Owns its own outcomes.** The skill posts the verdict, merges approved PRs, and
  transitions issue labels itself; the orchestrator does **not** relabel afterward. Its
  label side effects feed the other phases (approve → `ready for prod release` → Promote;
  request-changes → `pr pending actions` → Revise).

CI gate (before any review session): the PR's checks are read first. Red →
comment the failing checks on the PR and relabel `pr pending actions` so revise
fixes them, no review spent (capped at 2 bounces since the last review, then it
reviews anyway). Running → wait a pass. No CI → review as before.

Gating (`findPRsNeedingReview`): an open `featureBranch → baseBranch` PR whose linked
issue is `pr under review` (not `pr pending actions`) and with no review by
`reviewerLogin` newer than the PR's latest commit (freshness guard against re-review
loops). Every run's full turn-by-turn interaction (`--output-format stream-json`) is
written to `logs/review/<repo>-cycle<N>-<ts>.log` for debugging.

Disabled by default; opt in per repo with `reviewEnabled` and give each such repo a
`reviewSkillPath` (global or per repo — there is no default, startup fails without
one). `reviewSkillPath` and `reviewerLogin` cascade per repo like `model`. See
README "Review phase (opt-in)" for the full config table.

## State (persisted to disk)

Durable state lives in `.agent-state.json` in the daemon's directory (not the target
repo), written after every change and loaded on startup so the daemon survives restarts.

- `implemented` — issue numbers already delivered by a PR (self-heals when a tracked
  entry has no delivering PR — see `docs/implemented-cache-self-heal.md`).
- `skipped` — per-issue back-off records for issues the agent deliberately declined
  (investigation-only, blocked-on-external-verification); cleared on success or after
  the back-off window. Some transient skip reasons are re-checked and admitted early.
- `failed` / failure counters — per-repo consecutive-failure counts with cooldown
  (after `MAX_RETRIES` failures, skip the repo for `FAILURE_COOLDOWN_CYCLES`). A run refused by
  an upstream limit (GitHub rate limit, Claude session limit) is never charged.

In-memory only: `implementing` mutex and the upstream back-off state (both reset on
restart — safe).

## Prerequisites

- `claude` CLI installed and authenticated
- `gh` CLI installed; tokens supplied via env (`FOREMAN_GITHUB_TOKEN`; `EM_GITHUB_TOKEN`
  when the Review phase is enabled)
- Node.js >= 18

## Key design decisions

- **Skills own the workflow; the Foreman just triggers.** Implement/revise/review logic
  lives in skills (in the service repo for implement/revise, in `emRepoPath` for review),
  not in TypeScript. The daemon discovers work, spawns Claude on the right skill, and
  reconciles labels/state.
- **One Claude session at a time** — resource + git-state safety.
- **Phase order is the priority order** — reconcile and review settle prior-cycle state
  before new implementation starts.
- **Additive, opt-in config** — new capabilities (e.g. Review) default off so existing
  `.ai-agent.json` files keep working unchanged.
- **Disk persistence** — `.agent-state.json` survives restarts; the daemon resumes where
  it left off.
