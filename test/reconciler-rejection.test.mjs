// Guards for the reconciler's rejection handling and its git error reporting.
//
// Source-level assertions on purpose: reconcileRepo shells out to `git` and `gh`
// against a real clone, so exercising it here would need a fixture repo and a
// GitHub double. What actually regressed in the incidents these guard was the
// SHAPE of the code — a lookup that only saw open PRs, and a catch block that
// threw away the reason — and that is what these pin.
