// Regression tests for the dependency BATCH issue — the path a version bump
// takes once Dependabot targets the feature branch.
//
// Origin: owner decision, 2026-09-07. Until now a dependency PR was merged by a
// phase that reads a CI check rollup and nothing else — no session, no build, no
// server started. A check rollup proves the code compiles; it never proves the
// application still runs, which is why `express` 4 -> 5 sat green and one review
// away from production in two repos on the same day.
//
// The fix routes bumps through the implement session instead, and that session
// is issue-driven: the review phase starts from issues labelled `pr under
// review`, promotion queries issues carrying the EM gate, and the promotion PR
// body is a list of issue numbers. A dependency PR with no issue can reach
// `develop` and then has no route to `main` at all.
//
// Run with `npm test` (node:test, no dependencies) after `npm run build`.
