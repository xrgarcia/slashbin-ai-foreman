// Regression tests for the EM outcome-gate guard.
//
// `ready for prod release` is the one label that authorizes production. The
// review path writes labels through an agent the Foreman cannot intercept, so
// the guarantee is: whatever the agent does, an EM gate that existed before a
// review run still exists after it.
//
// Origin: Slashbin-io-docs, 2026-08-04. The gate was signed at 20:20:15Z and
// overwritten with `pr approved` at 20:22:12Z by a review run that had started
// at 20:11:59Z — before the gate existed, so the trigger-time exclusion in
// findPRsNeedingReview could not see it. findReadyForProdIssues then returned an
// empty set, tryPromotion returned early, and the promotion sat stalled for an
// hour with no error and no log line.
//
// Run with `npm test` (node:test, no dependencies) after `npm run build`.

// --- Timeline-based revocation detection -----------------------------------
//
// The first version of this guard snapshotted which issues held the gate BEFORE
// a review run and restored those. It shipped, and then failed on the exact
// scenario the bug report described. Slashbin-io-docs#269:
//
//   13:52:25Z  review run triggered   -> snapshot taken, gate not yet applied
//   13:57:41Z  EM signs the gate      -> invisible to the snapshot
//   13:58:20Z  review agent removes it
//   13:58:xx   guard restores nothing, because its snapshot was empty
//
// The rule below is time-symmetric: it asks whether the label was taken away
// during the window, never whether it existed before the window.
