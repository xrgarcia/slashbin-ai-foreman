**The autonomous engineering delegator behind [slashbin.io](https://www.slashbin.io?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=ai-foreman) — the webhook ETL gateway for engineers and AI agents. [Try slashbin.io free →](https://www.slashbin.io?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=ai-foreman)**

**Turn approved GitHub issues into shipped pull requests — autonomously, across every repo you own.**

- **Cost:** $0 marginal under your Claude Max plan. Runs through the Claude Code CLI — no API charges, no SaaS subscription, no per-run fees.
- **Safety:** Can't merge to `main` without approval. Every PR goes through branch protection; a reviewer — human, or an EM bot from [slashbin-ai-team](https://github.com/xrgarcia/slashbin-ai-team) — signs off before promotion.
- **Scale:** One daemon manages many repos. Point it at your fleet, let it work overnight.

The Foreman is an AI engineering agent that polls your repos for approved work, invokes a Claude Code skill (e.g. `/implement-approved-issues`) on each service repo, opens PRs, and revises based on reviewer feedback. Reviewers — human or AI — stay in the loop via PR reviews.

## Who this is for

The Foreman shines when you have **more approved work than time to implement**. Three patterns:

**1. Consulting / agency operators** — you maintain service repos for multiple clients. One daemon polls every client's repo with its own trigger label, base branch, and skill paths. Billable hours stay on strategy and review; implementation ships overnight.

**2. Multi-business operators** — you run several companies, each with its own engineering backlog. Each business is an entry in the `repos` array; review flows, skills, and branch protection stay per-business.

**3. Single business, many service repos** — microservices, internal tool sprawl, or a monolith plus satellites. The Foreman picks up an approved issue in whichever repo it's labeled on and ships a PR there.

**Also useful for:**

- **Solo developers** who want their backlog to shrink while they sleep
- **Vibe coders** whose AI handles the planning — the Foreman handles the execution
- **Teams running AI employees** via [slashbin-ai-team](https://github.com/xrgarcia/slashbin-ai-team) who need autonomous implementation behind the coordination layer

## What the Foreman does

Each poll cycle runs six phases across every configured repo:

```
Reconciliation → Review → Revision → Implementation → Branch Sync → Promotion
```

1. **Reconcile** — detects orphaned commits on the features branch with no PR and creates one
2. **Review** *(opt-in)* — when `reviewEnabled` is set, invokes a review skill on open feature PRs awaiting review. The review skill runs in a **separate review repo** (`emRepoPath`) under a separate GitHub token, and owns its own merge + label decisions; its label side effects (approve → `pr approved`; request-changes → `pr pending actions`) feed the Promote and Revise phases, and the Foreman reconciles the outcome label from the run's trailer if the skill merged without setting it. Disabled by default — see [Review phase](#review-phase-opt-in)
3. **Revise** — finds PRs with pending review feedback and revises them (prioritized over new work)
4. **Implement** — picks up approved issues and invokes the repo's implementation skill via Claude Code (up to 3 issues per cycle; 1 in greenfield repos)
5. **Branch Sync** — merges main → develop to keep branches aligned after promotions
6. **Promote** — creates promotion PRs (develop → main) for issues labeled `ready for prod release`

- **Poll interval is configurable** — default 5 minutes (`pollIntervalMs` in config)
- **Multi-repo** — manages multiple repos in a single daemon, each with its own skill paths and config
- **Persists state across restarts** — picks up where it left off
- **Failure cooldown** — after 2 consecutive failures on a repo, skips it for 3 cycles before retrying
- **Graceful shutdown** — waits for in-progress work before stopping (60-second timeout)
- **Discord notifications** — optional; posts status updates to a Discord channel via WebSocket bridge. The Foreman runs without Discord — set `DISCORD_BOT_ID` and `DISCORD_STATUS_CHANNEL` to enable

## How it fits together

The Foreman is one layer in an AI engineering pipeline:

1. **Product Owner** defines what to build (issues in GitHub)
2. **Engineering Manager** decomposes epics into implementation tasks, approves them with the trigger label
3. **Foreman** picks up approved issues, invokes the implementation skill on each service repo, and opens PRs
4. **Reviewers** (human or AI) provide feedback on PRs — Foreman revises automatically
5. **Foreman** promotes merged work from develop → main via promotion PRs

The Foreman uses a **dual-token model**: one GitHub token for its own operations (creating PRs, managing labels) and a second token for the Engineering Manager (approving and merging PRs that require branch protection). This prevents the Foreman from self-approving its own work.

This is the pattern behind [www.slashbin.io](https://www.slashbin.io?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=ai-foreman_body) — structured context in, autonomous execution out. The Foreman doesn't need to understand your business. It reads the issue, reads the repo's CLAUDE.md, and invokes the skill.

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/xrgarcia/slashbin-ai-foreman.git
cd slashbin-ai-foreman
npm install && npm run build

# 2. Ensure claude and gh CLIs are installed and authenticated
claude --version
gh auth status

# 3. Start the daemon
npm start
```

## Daemon management

```bash
npm start          # Start daemon in background
npm stop           # Graceful stop (waits for in-progress work)
npm restart        # Stop + start
npm run status     # Show running state, uptime, recent logs
npm run logs       # Show last 30 lines of agent.log
npm run logs -- 100 # Show last 100 lines

# Foreground / debugging
npm run start:fg   # Run in foreground (ctrl+c to stop)
npm run once       # Run one poll cycle and exit
npm run dev        # Watch mode (auto-reload on source changes)
```

The daemon writes `.agent[-<repo>].pid` itself at startup, before it does any
work — not just when launched via `npm start`. A daemon started any other way
(`doppler run -- node dist/cli.js`, a detached shell, a supervisor) is therefore
still visible to `status`, `stop` and `restart`.

It also refuses to start when that PID file names a live process, so a second
daemon cannot end up reviewing and merging the same PRs as the first. A stale
file left by a killed daemon is taken over automatically.

## Configuration

Copy `.ai-agent.example.json` to `.ai-agent.json` and customize. Env vars override file values.

```bash
cp .ai-agent.example.json .ai-agent.json
# Edit .ai-agent.json with your repo paths, GitHub org, and any per-repo overrides
```

`.ai-agent.json` is gitignored — your runtime config stays local and never enters version control. Use the example file as a template; commit changes to it (not to your real `.ai-agent.json`) when you want to update the documented shape.

### Single-repo mode

For a single repo, set fields at the root level:

| Config Field | Env Var | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `repoPath` | `AI_AGENT_REPO_PATH` | `.` | Path to local repo clone |
| `githubRepo` | `AI_AGENT_GITHUB_REPO` | *(from git remote)* | GitHub `owner/repo` |
| `triggerLabel` | `AI_AGENT_TRIGGER_LABEL` | `approved` | Label that triggers implementation |
| `pollIntervalMs` | `AI_AGENT_POLL_INTERVAL_MS` | `300000` (5 min) | Poll interval in milliseconds |
| `issueCacheTtlMs` | `AI_AGENT_ISSUE_CACHE_TTL_MS` | `30000` (30 s) | How long a repo's open-issue snapshot stays warm. Keep it **below** `pollIntervalMs`. `0` disables caching. See [GitHub API budget](#github-api-budget) |
| `issueSnapshotLimit` | `AI_AGENT_ISSUE_SNAPSHOT_LIMIT` | `500` | Max open issues fetched per snapshot. Must exceed a repo's open-issue count; truncation is logged |
| `skillPath` | `AI_AGENT_SKILL_PATH` | — | Claude Code skill for implementation |
| `revisionSkillPath` | — | — | Claude Code skill for PR revision |
| `prompt` | `AI_AGENT_PROMPT` | *(built-in)* | Custom prompt template |
| `baseBranch` | `AI_AGENT_BASE_BRANCH` | `develop` | PR target branch |
| `featureBranch` | `AI_AGENT_FEATURE_BRANCH` | `features` | Branch to commit to |
| `maxTurns` | `AI_AGENT_MAX_TURNS` | `30` | Max agent turns per issue |
| `maxDurationMs` | `AI_AGENT_MAX_DURATION_MS` | `1800000` (30 min) | Max implementation time |
| `model` | `AI_AGENT_MODEL` | CLI default | Model for implement/revise. Cascades to every repo that sets no `model` of its own |
| `allowedTools` | — | `["Read","Write","Edit","Bash","Glob","Grep"]` | Tools the CLI can use |
| `logFormat` | `AI_AGENT_LOG_FORMAT` | `text` | `json` or `text` |
| `logLevel` | `AI_AGENT_LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error` |

### GitHub API budget

Each poll cycle spends **one GraphQL request per repo** for issue discovery. GitHub's GraphQL limit is **5,000 requests/hour per token**, so the discovery floor is:

```
repos × (3600000 / pollIntervalMs)   requests/hour
```

The daemon logs this as `estDiscoveryGraphQlPerHour` on startup — check it against 5,000 after adding repos or lowering the poll interval. 20 repos at a 60 s interval is 1,200/hour; the same 20 repos would need an interval under ~15 s before discovery alone threatened the ceiling. Merges, reviews, and promotions spend additional requests on top, but only when there is work.

This budget is why the discovery phases share **one open-issue snapshot per repo per cycle** rather than issuing a query per label. Before that change, six lookups each ran their own `gh issue list` — 20 repos on a 60 s interval came to ~7,200 requests/hour, which permanently exhausted the token and made roughly one lookup in six fail. A failed lookup silently skips that phase for that repo that cycle, so `approved` issues sat unimplemented with nothing but generic errors in the log.

Two consequences worth knowing:

- **Keep `issueCacheTtlMs` below `pollIntervalMs`**, or a cycle can be served entirely from the previous cycle's snapshot and an externally-applied `approved` label waits an extra cycle. The daemon warns at startup if you cross that line.
- **Rate-limit rejections are logged as `[gh] RATE LIMIT EXHAUSTED`** and are deliberately not retried — the budget is already spent. If you see them, raise `pollIntervalMs` or reduce the repo count.

### Multi-repo mode

Use the `repos` array to manage multiple repos in a single daemon. Each repo entry may override any of: `triggerLabel`, `baseBranch`, `featureBranch`, `skillPath`, `revisionSkillPath`, `prompt`, `model`, `maxTurns`, `maxDurationMs`. Anything not specified on the entry falls back to the top-level value (or its default).

```json
{
  "repos": [
    {
      "name": "console",
      "repoPath": "../my-console",
      "githubRepo": "org/my-console",
      "skillPath": ".claude/skills/implement-approved-issues/SKILL.md",
      "revisionSkillPath": ".claude/skills/revise-pr-feedback/SKILL.md"
    },
    {
      "name": "api",
      "repoPath": "../my-api",
      "githubRepo": "org/my-api",
      "skillPath": ".claude/skills/implement-approved-issues/SKILL.md",
      "revisionSkillPath": ".claude/skills/revise-pr-feedback/SKILL.md"
    },
    {
      "name": "big-feature-repo",
      "repoPath": "../my-monolith",
      "githubRepo": "org/my-monolith",
      "skillPath": ".claude/skills/implement-approved-issues/SKILL.md",
      "revisionSkillPath": ".claude/skills/revise-pr-feedback/SKILL.md",
      "maxTurns": 60,
      "maxDurationMs": 3000000
    }
  ],
  "triggerLabel": "approved",
  "pollIntervalMs": 120000,
  "maxTurns": 30,
  "maxDurationMs": 1800000
}
```

In the example above, `console` and `api` get the top-level `maxTurns: 30` and `maxDurationMs: 1800000`. `big-feature-repo` overrides both to allow longer Claude sessions for larger features in that repo only.

**Resolution order** for `maxTurns` / `maxDurationMs` (and `triggerLabel`, `baseBranch`, `featureBranch`):

1. Per-repo entry value (most specific)
2. Top-level `.ai-agent.json` value (or `AI_AGENT_*` env var, which overrides the file value)
3. Built-in default

Existing configs that don't specify per-repo overrides continue to behave identically — the top-level values still apply to every repo. Per-repo overrides are additive and optional.

### Discord notifications (optional)

Set these environment variables to enable status updates in Discord. The Foreman runs without them.

| Env Var | Description |
|---|---|
| `DISCORD_BOT_ID` | Your Discord bot's application ID |
| `DISCORD_STATUS_CHANNEL` | Channel ID for status messages |
| `DISCORD_BRIDGE_URL` | WebSocket bridge URL (default: `ws://127.0.0.1:9800`) |

### GitHub tokens

| Env Var | Description |
|---|---|
| `FOREMAN_GITHUB_TOKEN` | Token for Foreman operations (create PRs, manage labels) |
| `EM_GITHUB_TOKEN` | Token for Engineering Manager operations (approve/merge PRs behind branch protection) |

### Prompt template variables

The prompt supports these placeholders:

- `{{issue_number}}` — GitHub issue number
- `{{issue_title}}` — Issue title
- `{{issue_body}}` — Issue body (markdown)

## Using with skills

The Foreman delegates work by invoking Claude Code skills on each service repo. Two skill paths per repo:

- **`skillPath`** — invoked during the Implementation phase (e.g. `.claude/skills/implement-approved-issues/SKILL.md`)
- **`revisionSkillPath`** — invoked during the Revision phase when a PR has review feedback (e.g. `.claude/skills/revise-pr-feedback/SKILL.md`)

The Foreman passes the issue context to Claude and instructs it to read and follow the skill. The skill defines the repo-specific implementation workflow — how to branch, test, and structure the PR.

## Review phase (opt-in)

The Review phase closes the loop between Implementation and Revision by invoking a
**review skill** on open feature PRs awaiting review — automating the human/agent
reviewer step. It is **disabled by default** (`reviewEnabled: false`); a vanilla
config keeps the original five-phase behavior unchanged.

It differs from Implementation/Revision in three ways, because review is a
decision-layer workflow rather than an in-repo edit:

- **Runs in a separate review repo.** The review skill is invoked with its working
  directory set to `emRepoPath`, not the service repo — so it has the reviewer's own
  tooling (MCP servers, verification scripts, context docs) available.
- **Runs under a separate token.** Reviews and merges are attributed to the account
  behind `EM_GITHUB_TOKEN` (distinct from `FOREMAN_GITHUB_TOKEN`), keeping the
  reviewer identity separate from the implementer identity.
- **Owns its own outcomes.** The skill posts the verdict, merges approved PRs, and
  transitions issue labels itself. The label side effects feed the other phases:
  approve → `pr approved` (awaiting the human release gate); request-changes →
  `pr pending actions` (Revise). The Foreman reconciles the label as a backstop
  when the skill merged without setting it — see below.

### Outcome-label reconciliation

The merge is performed by code, but the *record* of what the merge meant used to be
left entirely to the review agent to remember to write. When a session ended after
merging but before labeling, the issue stayed at `pr under review` with its PR
already closed — invisible to every phase, since the review gate only matches OPEN
PRs. Measured over one week on a 20-repo fleet: **12 of 53 merges (~23%) stranded
their issue this way.**

The outcome was never actually unknown — it arrives in the `FOREMAN_REVIEW` trailer
the Foreman already parses. `reviewLabelReconcile` (default `true`) spends it: after
a run reports a merge, any linked issue still sitting at `pr under review` is moved
to the label its own trailer implies.

Four conditions gate every write, so the reconciler can only ever repair a missing
write — never invent one, never overrule anyone:

1. the issue is still at `pr under review` with no outcome label (a skill that
   labels correctly never reaches this code, so a healthy pipeline is unchanged);
2. a **merged** PR provably closed that issue, under the strict closing-keyword
   predicate (a bare "related to #N" never counts);
3. that PR emitted a trailer this run whose fields are unambiguous;
4. the reviewer did not declare a hold (below).

It never applies `ready for prod release`. That label authorizes production and
remains a human act.

Set `reviewLabelReconcile: false` (or `AI_AGENT_REVIEW_LABEL_RECONCILE=false`) to
keep labeling strictly agent-owned.

### Declaring a deliberate hold

A reviewer that merges but *intentionally* leaves the label unset — typically an
acceptance criterion that cannot be observed yet — appends an optional `hold=` field
to that PR's trailer:

```
FOREMAN_REVIEW pr=#100 verdict=APPROVE merged=yes deploy=SUCCESS hold=criterion-not-observable-until-0300z
```

The Foreman then neither sets the label nor re-verifies behind it, and surfaces the
issue as *held* rather than failed. The hold is persisted in `.agent-state.json`, so
it survives restarts, and clears automatically once the issue leaves the dead zone.

Without this, a deliberate hold and a dropped label are the same observation, and
automation has to guess — which means overwriting a correct judgment with a rubber
stamp.

The four-field trailer remains the contract: `hold=` is optional and trails the
original fields, so trailers written before it existed parse identically.

Every review run's full turn-by-turn interaction (`--output-format stream-json`) is
written verbatim to `logs/review/<repo>-cycle<N>-<timestamp>.log` for debugging.

A PR is gated into review only when its linked issue is labeled `pr under review`,
it has an open `featureBranch → baseBranch` PR, and there is no review by
`reviewerLogin` newer than the PR's latest commit (a freshness guard against
re-review loops).

Review config keys (all optional; global, with a per-repo `reviewEnabled` override):

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `reviewEnabled` | `false` | Enable the Review phase (per-repo override supported) |
| `emRepoPath` | — | Working dir for the review skill (the review repo). Required when enabled |
| `reviewSkillPath` | `.claude/skills/review-all-prs/SKILL.md` | Review skill, relative to `emRepoPath` |
| `reviewModel` | — | Model override for review runs (independent of `model`) |
| `reviewMaxTurns` | `200` | Max turns (review + verify is long-running) |
| `reviewMaxDurationMs` | `3600000` (60 min) | Max review duration |
| `reviewAllowedTools` | broad MCP + shell set | Tool surface for the review skill |
| `reviewerLogin` | `slashbin-engineering-manager` | GitHub login the review runs as (freshness guard) |
| `reviewLabelReconcile` | `true` | Set the outcome label from the run's own trailer when the skill merged without labeling. Env: `AI_AGENT_REVIEW_LABEL_RECONCILE` |

Requires `EM_GITHUB_TOKEN` in the environment when enabled.

## Image handling in issue bodies

Claude is multimodal — when an issue body or PR review comment contains markdown image references like `![alt](https://...)`, those images are part of the spec (mockups, screenshots, walkthrough frames). The Foreman appends instructions to its default and skill-driven prompts telling the agent to fetch each image to a temp file and `Read` it, so the model can see image content.

For private-repo image URLs (e.g. `github.com/<owner>/<repo>/raw/<branch>/<path>`) the fetch uses `GH_TOKEN`-authed `curl`. For public CDN URLs (e.g. `github.com/user-attachments/...`) no auth is required.

This is automatic for the built-in prompts (`skillPath` and the default implement/revise prompts). If you supply a fully custom `prompt` in config, include your own image-handling guidance — the Foreman does not modify custom prompts.

## Programmatic usage

```typescript
import { startDaemon, loadConfig, createLogger } from "slashbin-ai-foreman";

const config = loadConfig();
const logger = createLogger({ format: "json", level: "info" });
const daemon = startDaemon(config, logger);

// Graceful shutdown
process.on("SIGINT", () => daemon.stop());
```
