/**
 * Fast-forward the shared feature branch onto its base, and push.
 *
 * Why this exists: the implement skill's Phase 0 is `checkout features` +
 * `pull origin features`. Nothing has ever brought the base branch INTO
 * `features`. Dependabot PRs merge straight into the base, so the tree an
 * implement session builds and boots is missing every dependency bump landed
 * since the last feature merge. Measured 2026-09-10 across all twenty managed
 * repos: `features` was 0 ahead of base in every one, and behind by 3 to 300
 * commits; on `jerky_event_processor` the one file that actually differed was
 * `package-lock.json` (brace-expansion 2.1.3 vs 2.1.4).
 *
 * That matters more since 2026-09-07 (36c8f03), when `tryMergeDependencyPR` was
 * deleted and a dependency upgrade started going through an implement session
 * precisely so that something builds and STARTS the app. A session that boots a
 * 300-commit-stale tree does not prove what that change intended.
 *
 * FAST-FORWARD ONLY, deliberately (owner decision 2026-09-10):
 * - `--ff-only` cannot rewrite history and cannot invent a merge commit, so it
 *   is safe to run on a branch the daemon shares with its own working clone.
 * - When `features` is genuinely ahead (a feature PR is in flight, the normal
 *   mid-cycle state) the fast-forward is impossible and that is NOT a fault —
 *   the branch is doing its job. Report `work-in-flight` and let the session
 *   proceed; forcing it would discard unmerged commits.
 * - True divergence is the only failure, and it is reported rather than
 *   resolved. Auto-resolving is how a shared clone gets polluted, which is the
 *   documented cause of the "diverged from origin/features" dead-zone.
 *
 * Never force-pushes. Never resolves a conflict.
