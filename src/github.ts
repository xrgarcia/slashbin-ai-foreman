/**
 * The six discovery lookups in this file (`approved` ×2, `pr under review` ×2,
 * `pr pending actions`, `ready for prod release`) each used to issue their own
 * `gh issue list --state open` against the SAME repo. Every `gh issue list`
 * spends a GraphQL request, and GraphQL is capped at 5,000/hour per token.
 *
 * 2026-07-30: 20 repos × ~6 lookups × a 60s poll interval ≈ 7,200 GraphQL
 * calls/hour against that 5,000 ceiling. The Foreman token sat permanently
 * exhausted — 22,466 rejections in 24 hours — so roughly one lookup in six
 * failed outright. A failed lookup silently skips that phase for that repo
 * that cycle: an `approved` issue goes unimplemented, a
 * `ready for prod release` unpromoted, recovering only on a later cycle that
 * happens to win the quota race.
 *
 * The fix is that all six lookups are label subsets of ONE query. We fetch
 * `--state open` once per repo, cache it briefly, and filter in memory:
 * 6 calls → 1 (≈1,200/hour, comfortably inside budget) with the poll interval
 * left where operations wants it at 60s. Fetching every open issue instead of
 * a label-filtered slice costs no extra requests — the request count is driven
 * by pages, not by predicates.
 *
 * Correctness: the snapshot is dropped whenever the Foreman mutates an issue in
 * that repo (see `invalidateSnapshotIfMutating`), so a label written by an
 * earlier phase is never read back stale later in the same cycle. A label
 * changed EXTERNALLY — the EM applying `approved` — is picked up on the next
 * refresh, i.e. at worst one TTL late, which is a delay the poll interval
 * already implies.
 *
 * Additive and OSS-safe: `issueCacheTtlMs: 0` restores the old behaviour of one
 * live query per lookup.

 * 7 days (2026-07-29 → 08-04): 53 merges, 12 issues left mislabeled — ~23%. In the
 * worked example (slashbin-io-worker#575) the agent merged, verified, reported
 * `verdict=APPROVE merged=yes deploy=SUCCESS`, named the target label 24 times in
 * its own output, and never executed the write. The Foreman parsed that trailer,
 * logged it, and did nothing with it.
 *
 * Sibling of `resolveDeadZone`, which repairs the same state a cycle later from a
 * FRESH verification. This one is the first line of defense and needs no
 * re-verification because the verdict is the one the review just produced. Kept
 * separate rather than merged with it: the two differ in where their verdict comes
 * from, and that provenance is exactly what a reader needs to trust either one.
 *
 * Never applies `ready for prod release` — that label is the EM outcome-gate's
 * signature and stays a human act (separation of duties, 2026-07-27).

/**
 * Open Dependabot PRs into any of `bases`, and nothing else.
 *
 * **Why a list and not one branch (owner decision, 2026-09-07).** Dependabot is
 * moving from `target-branch: develop` to `target-branch: features`, so that a
 * dependency bump travels `features → develop → main` like every other change
 * instead of landing on `develop` and leaving `features` behind. That retarget
 * happens one repo at a time and cannot be simultaneous with this code change:
 * whichever went first, every dependency PR in the gap would be invisible here
 * and would sit unmerged with nothing logged. Accepting both branches for the
 * duration is the additive half of that swap. Drop `develop` once no repo aims
 * dependabot at it.
 *
 * Dependabot PRs never carry a linked issue, so the review phase cannot see
 * them: it is scoped to `features → develop` PRs and every step after the merge
 * (labelling, follow-up filing, the outcome trailer) is expressed in terms of an
 * issue. Rather than widen the skill that reviews and merges ALL feature work —
 * the highest-blast-radius thing here — these get their own mechanical path,
 * shaped exactly like the `main → develop` sync merge above: a narrow rule, no
 * agent, no issue.
 *
 * **The head-branch test is the safety property, not the label.** Dependabot
 * labels its PRs `dependencies` by default, but a label is something any account
 * can apply; `dependabot/*` is a branch only Dependabot writes. Selecting on the
 * branch means a mislabelled human PR can never be swept into an unreviewed
 * merge.

 * Dependabot at `features` only governs pull requests it opens from now on; on
 * 2026-09-07 twenty-four of the twenty-eight already open were sitting on
 * `develop`, where the merge phase would have swept them in on a green check
 * rollup — no session, no build, no boot. Excluding `features` from a mechanical
 * merge while leaving `develop` in it moved the defect one branch over rather
 * than removing it.
 *
 * `main` stays excluded outright: a dependency update must never be worked
