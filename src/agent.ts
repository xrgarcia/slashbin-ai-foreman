 * untrusted-workspace notice, deprecation warnings — so whenever a run failed
 * for an unrelated reason, that noise became the entire reported error and the
 * real cause was never recorded anywhere.
 *
 * Observed 2026-08-04 on slashbin-io-worker cycle 1519: the run died 12.5
 * minutes in and was reported as
 * `Implementation failed: Ignoring 5 permissions.allow entries ...`.
 * The identical warning appears on cycle 1520, which SUCCEEDED — so it could
 * not have been the cause, and the actual reason is unrecoverable. Ray brought
 * that message in as the failure; it was never even a symptom.
 *
 * The fix is precedence and labelling, not suppression: lead with the one
 * unambiguous fact (the exit code), then the agent's own output, then stderr
 * clearly marked as context. A warning can no longer appear alone, so it can no
 * longer read as a diagnosis.

 *   - token = EM_GITHUB_TOKEN, so reviews/merges are attributed to the EM account
 *             (memory: feedback_mcp_github_for_review_actions)
 *   - the broad reviewAllowedTools surface (GitHub/Postgres/Redis/Railway MCP)
 *
 * Full-fidelity: the skill posts verdicts, merges approved PRs to develop, verifies
 * dev, files S3/S4 follow-ups, and updates labels itself. The review's label side
 * effects feed the existing phases: APPROVE → `pr approved` (awaiting the EM
 * outcome-gate); REQUEST_CHANGES → `pr pending actions` (revise phase).
 *
 * The skill remains the PRIMARY labeler — it does things the orchestrator cannot
 * (post the review body, file the follow-ups that belong with the verdict). But it
 * is no longer the ONLY one: the orchestrator reconciles the outcome label from the
 * returned trailers when the skill merged without labeling. See
 * `reconcileReviewOutcomeLabels` in orchestrator.ts for why the write moved.

Review the open feature PRs for the repository \`${repoConfig.githubRepo}\` ONLY. Treat this as the skill's repo-scoped mode (equivalent to \`--repo ${repoConfig.githubRepo}\`): scope every step — inventory, review, merge, verify — to that single repository, and use the full \`owner/repo\` slug \`${repoConfig.githubRepo}\` for all GitHub operations (do not rely on a short repo alias).

WORKING COPY — use this one, do not make your own:
A checkout of \`${repoConfig.githubRepo}\` is already prepared and fetched for you at \`${checkoutPathFor(agentConfig, repoConfig)}\`. Read the code there: \`git -C <that path> checkout <branch>\`, \`git -C <that path> diff\`, and so on. It is reused across runs, so its \`node_modules\` is usually already installed.
Do NOT \`git clone\` this repo anywhere else, and do NOT clone into \`/tmp\` for any reason. \`/tmp\` here is a RAM filesystem with a hard limit on the NUMBER of files, and a repo plus its \`node_modules\` consumes tens of thousands of them; improvised review clones exhausted that limit on 2026-09-12 and left every agent on the box unable to run a single command, including the ones needed to clean it up. If you need a second working tree, use \`git -C <that path> worktree add\` inside that same directory — it shares the object store instead of duplicating it.

Follow the skill exactly and act autonomously — do NOT ask questions or wait for confirmation:
- Do NOT run healthchecks up front. A healthcheck verifies a deployment; a review that requests changes deploys nothing. Run them only in post-merge verification (skill Phase 5, via \`npm run verify\`), against a merge this run actually made.
- Review each open \`features → develop\` PR (skill Phase 3): the Fix-Completeness gate first, then the rubric.
- For APPROVED PRs: post the review from the EM account, merge to develop, then verify dev and label \`pr approved\` per the skill. Do NOT apply \`ready for prod release\`, and do NOT remove it either — that label is the EM outcome-gate's signature (separation of duties; see /review-pr Step 17). If a linked issue already carries it, the EM has signed off ahead of you: leave that issue's labels alone entirely. Removing it silently blocks the promotion PR forever, so the Foreman now detects and restores it — but a restore is a repaired mistake, not a supported path.
- For BLOCKED PRs: post REQUEST_CHANGES, label the linked issue \`pr pending actions\`, and file S3/S4 follow-up issues per the skill.
- Update issue labels yourself exactly as the skill specifies. The orchestrator reconciles the outcome label from your trailer only when you left it unset — it never overrides a label you did set.

CRITICAL — THIS IS A HEADLESS SESSION. THERE IS NO NEXT TURN.
Ending your turn ends the process. Anything still running is killed at that instant, and everything you had not done yet never happens.

- NEVER end your turn to "wait" for something. There is nothing to wait with. Do not say "I'll wait for X to land", "let me check back", or "proceeding once this completes" — those sentences are how a merged PR gets left with a mislabeled issue forever.
- Run post-merge verification IN THE FOREGROUND and block on it. Do NOT launch it as a background task and yield — a backgrounded verify is killed the moment you stop, so its result never arrives and the labeling step after it never runs.
- The merge is irreversible and the labeling is not automatic. Once you merge a PR you MUST, in the same turn, finish verification and set the issue's labels. If you cannot finish, say so explicitly in your final message rather than stopping quietly.
- If a step genuinely cannot complete (verification times out, a deploy never settles), do NOT stall — record the outcome, label the issue \`pr pending actions\`, and emit the trailer with \`deploy=FAILURE\`. A reported failure is recoverable; silence is not.

If there are no open feature PRs awaiting review for this repo, that is a clean no-op — say so and emit exactly \`FOREMAN_REVIEW none\` as your final line.

IMPORTANT — status trailer: After you finish, end your output with one line per PR you acted on, in EXACTLY this format (nothing after the last one):

FOREMAN_REVIEW pr=#<number> verdict=<APPROVE|REQUEST_CHANGES> merged=<yes|no> deploy=<SUCCESS|FAILURE|NA>

Rules for the trailer: \`merged=yes\` only if you actually merged the PR to the base branch. \`deploy=SUCCESS\`/\`deploy=FAILURE\` reflects the post-merge deployment+verification result for that merge (use \`deploy=NA\` when nothing was merged, or when the repo has no deployment to verify, e.g. a docs/CLI/npm-package repo). Emit one trailer line for every PR you reviewed this run.

OPTIONAL — deliberate hold: if you merged a PR but are INTENTIONALLY leaving the issue at \`pr under review\` (e.g. an acceptance criterion cannot be observed yet), append \`hold=<short-reason-slug>\` to that PR's trailer line:

FOREMAN_REVIEW pr=#100 verdict=APPROVE merged=yes deploy=SUCCESS hold=criterion-not-observable-until-0300z

Use it ONLY for a decision you actually made. It tells the Foreman the label is missing ON PURPOSE, so it will neither auto-set the label nor auto-re-verify behind you — the issue stays visible as a held item instead of being reported as a failure. Omit the field entirely for the normal case; omitting it means "I finished the labeling."

Note: the Foreman now reconciles the outcome label from this trailer as a BACKSTOP — if you merged and did not label, it applies the label your trailer implies. That is a safety net, not a substitute: still set the labels yourself per the skill, because only you can file the follow-ups and post the review body that go with them.

The trailer is MANDATORY and is the last thing you emit. A run that ends without either a \`FOREMAN_REVIEW pr=…\` line or \`FOREMAN_REVIEW none\` is recorded as a FAILED review regardless of how much work you did, because from the outside it is indistinguishable from a session that died mid-merge.
